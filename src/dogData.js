      "Pooh Bear was littermate to Shonka and an unplanned acquisition.  We were supposed to be getting a puppy (Shonka) for Jason, but 7-week-old Pooh Bear tugged at Dad's heart, and so we adopted both.  Like his cartoon namesake, Pooh Bear was sweet, lovable, and sometimes hapless (\"Da Bear!\").  Pooh became Bryan's best buddy and Dad's enthusiastic retriever of ducks.  At the end of a long, hard day swimming or wrestling with his brother, he would plop on top of whomever was laying on his couch.  Pooh Bear was an amazing combination of sweet house pet and competent hunting companion.",

Shonka had a classic, blocky head and soulful, intelligent eyes that let you know he was gently in charge.  The oil on his fur had a distinctive odor that we affectionately called the "Shonka stinkies."  While exceptionally intelligent and empathetic for a lab, Shonka\'s most noteworthy talent was his ability to sing along with the piano.  He would accompany whoever was playing and match the mood of the music with the tone and volume of his artistic howls.  Shonka was something special.',

He could remember the location of 5 distant dummies and retrieve them flawlessly with little or no guidance.  At home, he was an enthusiastic and accomplished opener of presents, and he loved to cuddle up with Dad in their favorite chair to read and nap.  Mishka loved his "up time" with Dad.',

He was the most intelligent, amiable, easy-going dog we have ever known.  He had a great sense of humor and loved romping with Sunny, Mishka, and Taiga.

      'Josey… Queen Josephine… or simply Her Majesty… is a canine version of Cinderella.  Born into a litter whelped by a Reservation stray at the local shelter, our very own "Rez Mutt" began her royal career under Sunny\'s tutelage and grew into a gentle 94-pound beauty who now rules her Teal River Kingdom.  Part Rottweiler, part Pitbull, part lots-of-stuff, Josey carries her beautiful head and majestic tail with great dignity.  Her "spots" include the recliner (when Sandy wants it), the couch (when Dave wants it), Bryan\'s lap, and Sandy\'s pillows on the bed (whenever she wants).  Josey talks when she wants something (like solo mid-day walks with Dave) and speaks occasionally on behalf of Ten Bears - such a smart girl.',

He is an enthusiastic retriever of balls and Frisbees, by land or sea; and he is the king of keep-away.  "Going with" to the dump or the lake is a big treat.  Indoors, Ten Bears is sweet, calm, and cuddly.  He maintains Mishka\'s "up time" tradition and dutifully accompanies Sandy to bed every night, keeping my side warm until I get there.',

Holly is very sweet and cuddly, but she has a stubborn, mischievous side that may have arisen from the 2% wolf in her ancestry.  She frequently steals socks and gloves and then ransoms them for treats.  Holly and Ten Bears will chase and play and yap and carry on for hours at a time.   The two are truly Best Friends Forever.",

    summary:
      'In October of 2020, Jason & Lena picked up a male Belgian Tervuren at the Seattle airport.  They named him Loki - a "trickster" in Norse Mythology and companion to Odin and Thor.  Puppy Loki wasn\'t enamored of thunder at first (hid under Jason\'s desk), but soon he became a curious, confident, athletic member of the family.  Loki learned quickly that ducks are for watching, not chasing or eating.  He and Lena\'s favorite duck, Yogi, have a permanent truce that involves sharing cucumbers.  Loki loves to hunt truffles, run fast, jump high, and retrieve balls until your arm falls off.  He is now applying his strength and athleticism to the sport of skijoring, so he\'s happy to be "going with" when the gear comes out.',
