      "Pooh Bear was littermate to Shonka and an unplanned acquisition.  We were supposed to be getting a puppy (Shonka) for Jason, but 7-week-old Pooh Bear tugged at Dad's heart, and so we adopted both.  Like his cartoon namesake, Pooh Bear was sweet, lovable, and sometimes hapless (\"Da Bear!\").  Pooh became Bryan's best buddy and Dad's enthusiastic retriever of ducks.  At the end of a long, hard day swimming or wrestling with his brother, he would plop on top of whomever was laying on his couch.  Pooh Bear was an amazing combination of sweet house pet and competent hunting companion.",

      'Shonka ("dog" in Lakota) was littermate to Pooh Bear and Jason\'s best friend growing up.  Shonka had a classic, blocky head and soulful, intelligent eyes that let you know he was gently in charge.  The oil on his fur had a distinctive odor that we affectionately called the "Shonka stinkies."  While exceptionally intelligent and empathetic for a lab, Shonka\'s most noteworthy talent was his ability to sing along with the piano.  He would accompany whoever was playing and match the mood of the music with the tone and volume of his artistic howls.  Shonka was something special.',

He could remember the location of 5 distant dummies and retrieve them flawlessly with little or no guidance.  At home, he was an enthusiastic and accomplished opener of presents, and he loved to cuddle up with Dad in their favorite chair to read and nap.  Mishka loved his "up time" with Dad.',

      'Sunny was an AKC-registered golden retriever ("Teal River Sunrise") with a heart of gold.  He, too, was an unplanned acquisition.  (Mom was retiring and Mishka needed a buddy to play with.)   Sunny was several months old when we heard about him from a friend who had bought a littermate.  Sunny was timid and submissive at first - quite uncertain about his new world.  But with patience and love, Sunny developed into a beautiful, strong, athletic, leader of the pack.  He was also as sweet and gentle and willing to please as any dog we\'ve ever known.  He patiently taught Josey how to be a dog.',

Taiga taught Lena how to be a first-time dog owner, while Taiga learned to be a world traveler.  "Going with!" was Taiga\'s favorite phrase, and go she did.  From wilderness Alaska to the bustling Borough of Queens and the forests of northern Wisconsin where skijoring was initiated, Taiga tagged along with Jason and Lena on their exploits and travels.  She was an annual holiday season guest of Sunny, Mishka, & Keenai - a charter member of “the pack.”',

    summary:
      'In October of 2020, Jason & Lena picked up a male Belgian Tervuren at the Seattle airport.  They named him Loki - a "trickster" in Norse Mythology and companion to Odin and Thor.  Puppy Loki wasn\'t enamored of thunder at first (hid under Jason\'s desk), but soon he became a curious, confident, athletic member of the family.  Loki learned quickly that ducks are for watching, not chasing or eating.  He and Lena\'s favorite duck, Yogi, have a permanent truce that involves sharing cucumbers.  Loki loves to hunt truffles, run fast, jump high, and retrieve balls until your arm falls off.  He is now applying his strength and athleticism to the sport of skijoring, so he\'s happy to be "going with" when the gear comes out.',
